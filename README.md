# Project Log

Quick little project to help keep track of the logs that I keep while working on a project.

## Models
Users have Projects.  
Each Project has LogEntries.

## Display
The site is very simple and stripped down.  

The 'dashboard' page of the logged in user displays all the log entries in the database, from most recent to older.  At the top of the dashboard page is a martor markdown editor to enter the newest entry.

LogEntries can be filtered by Project and Date Range.

There is no header.  A simple footer to mark the bottom of the page.

A left side bar shows links to 'home', the dashboard page, a top-level link to the projects page, new project and a list of all the available projects.
